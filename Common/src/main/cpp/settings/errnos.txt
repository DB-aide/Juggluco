       EACCES Permission bits of the file mode do not permit the requested access, or search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix.

       ELOOP  A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the path argument.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than {NAME_MAX}.

       ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing file or path is an empty string.

       ENOTDIR
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory, or the path argument contains
              at  least  one  non-<slash>  character and ends with one or more trailing <slash> characters and the last pathname component names an existing file
              that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       EROFS  Write access is requested for a file on a read-only file system.

       The faccessat() function shall fail if:

       EACCES The access mode of the open file description associated with fd is not O_SEARCH and the permissions of the directory underlying fd  do  not  permit
              directory searches.

       EBADF  The path argument does not specify an absolute path and the fd argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file descriptor open for reading or search-
              ing.

       ENOTDIR
              The path argument is not an absolute path and fd is a file descriptor associated with a non-directory file.

       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of the amode argument is invalid.

       ELOOP  More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the path argument.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result with a length  that  exceeds
              {PATH_MAX}.
