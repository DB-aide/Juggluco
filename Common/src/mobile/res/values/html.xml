<![CDATA[
<h1>Add connection</h1>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Specify a connection
with another instance of Juggluco. Juggluco on one device sends via
IP/TCP data to a Juggluco on another device. To establish a
connection, one of the Juggluco\'s has to listen on a port and the
other has to make contact to that port. The port this instance of
Juggluco is listening on, was given in the previous screen (Left
middle menu-&gt; Mirror). Here you specify the port this instance of
Juggluco contacts to if it actively makes contact. If this instance
of Juggluco can\'t listen on a port, select &quot;<b>Active only</b>&quot;.
If the other side can\'t listen on a port, select &quot;<b>Passive
only</b>&quot;, otherwise leave &quot;<b>Both</b>&quot; checked. The
Juggluco on the other side should specify <i>Passive only </i>if you
select here <i>Active only</i> and <i>Active only</i> if you select
here <i>Passive</i> <i>only</i> and <i>Both</i> if you select here
<i>Both</i>.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If this instance of
Juggluco actively makes contact, you should specify the IP(s) it
should contact with. If that host has multiple IPs, you specify more
than one; for example when two devices are sometimes connected via a
home network and sometimes directly as portable hotspot. Never
specify the IPs of multiple devices, in that case they will each
receive only part of the data. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">In all cases except
\'Active only\', you can select \'<b>Detect</b>\'; in this case Juggluco
saves the first IP contacting Juggluco as the IP of the other side.
Verifying if the right device is making contact can in two ways:
Select \'<b>Test IP</b>\' to test the IP. If you select <b>Test Label</b>,
a contact is only established if both sides have specified the same
label.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Select <b>receive
from</b> if you want this app to function as mirror app. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If you want this
device to be the <b>sender</b> of data, you have to specify which
data to send.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Amounts</b>:
dose, food and sport data you have specified.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Scans</b>: data
received by scanning the sensor (scans and history).</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Stream</b>: the
data received by Bluetooth.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes some data
is already present on the receiving device. You can specify until
when this data is present:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><i>Start: </i>no
data present</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><i>Now: </i>all data
present</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Or a specific date
determined by the begin position of the screen.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">When a data source
is added to an existing connection, the start date determined only
the added data source. For example if Scans and Streams were already
send to the host, and Amounts are now added, the start date only
determines the Amounts send. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">In case two devices
are connected via an insecure connection, data can be signed and
encrypted by specifying the same (maximal) 16-character <b>password</b>
on both sides of the connection. Select <b>Save</b> to save what you
have specified. <b>Delete</b> will delete this connection
specification.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">In the simplest
situation all connections belong to your home network, so you can use
local IPs. You can also connect over the internet via Wi-Fi, in that
case you should consult you modem manual on how to forward an
external port to an IP and port on you home network. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Two smartphones
connected via a mobile data connection over internet can directly
connect with each other, if one of them can listen on a network port.
If both can\'t (for example if neither has an individual IP), they can
still communicate with each other via a third device. One possibility
is to run Juggluco on an Android device (minimal Android 4.4) at home
connected to the internet via a modem. Another possibility is to run
a command line program belonging to Juggluco on a computer (e.g. your
PC or Amazon AWS):

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It is possible to
receive glucose values via Bluetooth on a device without NFC (see
<a href="http://jkaltes.byethost16.com/Juggluco/mirror">http://jkaltes.byethost16.com/Juggluco/mirror</a>):
Initialize the sensor via NFC on the NFC device and then send the
Scan and Stream data to the non-NFC device.Hereafter reverse the
connection for Stream date and turn off the Bluetooth connection in
the NFC device and on in the none-NFC device and also turn off
&quot;sensor via Bluetooth&quot; in the NFC-device and on in the
non-NFC device. So you can scan with one device and get glucose
values via Bluetooth on another device. But on all devices all sensor
data should be available. If devices exchange data, they always
should receive both scan and stream data. So you should always send
the Stream data back to the NFC device and the scan data back to the
non-NFC device. Otherwise, the data will get out of sync leading to
old authentication data being used or new data being overwritten with
old data.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The Amounts data is
totally independent.</p>
<h2 class="western">Network problems</h2>
<p>A strict complementary specification on both sides of the
connection is necessary. One simple omission can make data
transmission impossible.</p>
<p>It is possible that the connection hangs and has to be reset by
turning WIFI on or off or pressing Sync. Also, switching an
<i>activeonly-passiveonly</i> connection to <i>both</i> or the other
way around can make a difference.</p>
<p>For example a watch-phone connection using TCP over Bluetooth only
works if the watch is activeonly and the phone passiveonly. Over WIFI
it works in both directions.</p>
<p>You should also consider change of IPs with change of connection.
For example different IPs have to be used on the home network than
over a portable hotspot.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Select whether
glucose values should be given in mmol/L or dm/dL.</p>
<h2 class="western">Graph range: low-high.</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Give a low and high
value, so that the bottom of the screen correspondents to the lowest
and the top to the highest. These values are only used when all the
glucose values displayed on the screen are within these bounds.
Otherwise, the bounds are widened so that all values are visible.
When you take 3 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) and 9 mmol/L (162 mg/dL), and all
the values on the visible display are between 5 mmol/L and 6 mmol/L,
the graph displays a glucose axis from 3 to 9. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If <b>Manually scale
Glucose</b> is turned on, you can change this: moving your finger
over the top of the screen, moves the top half of the graph up and
down; moving over the bottom of the screen moves the bottom half of
the graph up and down.</p>
<h2 class="western">Target range: low-high</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The higher side of
the display is colored differently so you can see high values easier.
The same is true for low values. A red line is displayed to show the
too low side of the display.</p>
<h2 class="western">Glucose-axis numbers LEFT</h2>
<p>Place the numbers of the glucose level in the graph on the left of
the screen. Useful if you want to place your current glucose in the
middle of the screen, for example in Wear OS.</p>
<h2 class="western">Invert screen</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Turn the display
upside down. It is switch on by default, because otherwise I did now
and then accidentally touch OK while scanning a sensor.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Some people ask for
portrait mode, but I have turned that off, because it is totally
inappropriate for the display of the glucose graph.</p>
<h2 class="western">Nfc sound</h2>
<p>Make sound during scanning in addition to vibration.</p>
<h2 class="western">Scanning starts app</h2>
<p>If checked this app will be started when you scan a sensor via NFC
even if this app is not displayed. If multiple apps have this
setting, android will display a chooser from which to select which
app you want to use. Somehow choosing one doesn\'t work and selecting
one to be chosen the next time neither. So in this case you can\'t
scan without an app in the foreground. Turning it off in this app,
will make it possible that at least one app can be activated this
way.</p>
<p>If you have root access, you can also disable NFC activation of
Abbott\'s Librelink app (doesn\'t work with Libre3):</p>
<p>Become root in adb shell or termux, and type:</p>
<p>pm disable
com.freestylelibre.app.nl/com.librelink.app.ui.common.NFCScanActivity</p>
<p>On Librelink 2.7.1 and lower you had to press:</p>
<p>pm disable
com.freestylelibre.app.nl/com.librelink.app.ui.common.ScanSensorActivity</p>
<p><span lang="en-US">com.freestylelibre.app.nl is here the Dutch
version of Librelink, this should be replaced with the version you
are using. You can find its name by typing</span> <span lang="en-US">(even
without root):</span></p>
<p>pm list package freestylelibre</p>
<p>Afterwards, you can still use Librelink for scanning when it is in
the foreground, but it will not be started otherwise. Librelink 2.5.2
and higher crash themselves if they detect root. But in Magisk you
can easily hide root by renaming Magisk and adding individual apps to
the denylist (Magisk 24.3) or Magiskhide (Magisk 23.0). You should
also add Juggluco to the denylist. Except when you use US Freestyle
Libre 2 sensors, you can also use an older version of Librelink
without root check.</p>
<p>Without root, under adb shell, you can also disable the whole app:</p>
<p>pm disable-user --user 0 com.freestylelibre.app.nl</p>
<p>Before calling Abbott customer service, you can re-enable it with:</p>
<p>pm enable com.freestylelibre.app.nl</p>
<h2 class="western">Libreview</h2>
<p>Connect with Libreview to send Freestyle Libre 2 and 3 glucose
values and amounts to Libreview and to get the account id used during
Freestyle Libre 3 sensor activation. Touch to change settings.</p>
<h2 class="western">Librelink broadcast</h2>
<p>Use the Librelink broadcast (originally send by the patched German
Librelink app 2.3.0), to send the Bluetooth glucose stream data every
minute to xDrip. In xDrip you need to set Libre2 (patched App) as
hardware data source. The glucose values displayed in xDrip are
different from the values it receives. For some reason xDrip only
updates its value every 5 minutes, probably because it was made for
devices that send only once per 5 minutes (A watch face connected to
xDrip regularly displayed more than 9 minute old values.) In
addition, xDrip displays its own interpretation of received glucose
values. Mirror devices can also sent to xDrip.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/jakobheyman/xdripJH">https://github.com/jakobheyman/xdripJH</a>
for an attempt to update the glucose value of xDrip every minute.</p>
<p>Freestyle Libre 3 sensors send missed values after a disconnection
period. These values are not sent with this broadcast. You will
receive them if you turn on the Web server in Juggluco and make xDrip
a Nightscout follower of Juggluco. Nightscout server:
http://127.0.0.1:17580</p>
<p>Juggluco can also directly contact with xDrip watch apps, so that
the watch app displays more recent glucose values. To use this
feature check <i>&quot;xDrip webserver&quot;</i> in the left menu
under <b>Watch</b>. See Help under left menu-&gt;watch for more
information. Only one app can listen to the network port used by the
xDrip webserver, so you need to turn off &quot;<i>xDrip webservice</i>&quot;
in xDrip itself if you want to make use of the one in Juggluco.</p>
<h2 class="western">xDrip broadcast</h2>
<p>Send the same broadcast as turned on in xDrip with
&quot;<i>Settings-&gt;Inter-app settings-&gt;Broadcast locally&quot;</i>
(com.eveningoutpost.dexdrip.BgEstimate). Apps like AndroidAPS listen
to it. Apps targeting Android 11 or higher need to add the following
to AndroidManifest.xml for it to work: 
</p>
<p>&lt;queries&gt; <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;package
android:name=&quot;tk.glucodata&quot;/&gt; <br/>
&lt;/queries&gt; 
</p>
<p>Every minute Juggluco sends a glucose value to all apps listening
to this broadcast, xDrip only to a few well known applications,
except when you explicitly specify the name.</p>
<h2 class="western">Glucodata broadcast</h2>
<p>A new broadcast that has the same function as the xDrip broadcast.
A simple example app that writes received glucose values to logcat
you can find here: <a href="http://jkaltes.byethost16.com/Juggluco/glucosebroadcast.html">Glucose
broadcasts</a>. If you specify Juggluco as data-source in G-Watch,
you need to turn on this broadcast.</p>
<p>The application apps listening to this broadcast are shown. Check
the apps you want to send this broadcast to.</p>
<h2 class="western">Web server</h2>
<p>Web server that can be used with xDrip watches and some Nightscout
apps. Previously called xDrip webserver.</p>
<h2 class="western">Uploader</h2>
<p>Upload to a Nightscout server.</p>
<h2 class="western">Glucose in android status bar</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If set, glucose
values streaming via Bluetooth are quietly displayed in a
notification and the android status bar. If you turn it off, instead
of a number, a dot is shown and the notification tells nothing more
than &quot;<i>To connect to sensor</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>To exchange
data</i>&quot;. An app that stays running in the background, is
obliged by Android to have such visible notification (otherwise it is
easily stopped by Android). Juggluco only turns off the notification,
when &quot;<i>Sensor via Bluetooth</i>&quot; is turned off and there
are no mirror connections.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">On some smartphones,
the glucose value is only shown in the Android status bar after
changing Androids notification settings. On Realme GT 5G for example,
you have to go to applist-&gt;Juggluco-&gt;manage notifications, tab
on glucoseNotification and turn off &quot;Set to Silent&quot;.
&quot;Display in status bar&quot; will now be shown turned on.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
You can also get an android notification by selecting <i>Notify</i>
in the left middle menu. In that case the notification will be sent
to some smartwatches, if it is configured that way. That works with
Garmin watches, I don\'t know if it works with anything else. Alarms
also generate notifications.</p>
<h2 class="western">Floating glucose</h2>
<p>When you turn this on, a small image with the current glucose
value is constantly present on the screen independent of which app is
in the foreground. If you turn it on the first time, you will be
directed to a list of apps in which you have to give Juggluco
permission to <b>display over other apps</b>.</p>
<h2 class="western">Config</h2>
<p>Specify font size and colors of <i>Floating glucose</i> value.</p>
<h2 class="western">Sensor via Bluetooth</h2>
<p>Selects whether this app connects via Bluetooth with a Freestyle
libre 2 or 3 sensor. This is needed for alarms and continual glucose
monitoring.</p>
<h2 class="western"><b>Alarms</b></h2>
<p style="font-weight: normal">Set high en low glucose alarms, loss
of signal alarm and value available notification.</p>
<h2 class="western">Number Labels</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Specify the labels
used for amounts. Go to a screen to determine which labels to use to
set amounts, like insulin doses, carbohydrate consumption and hours
spend playing football. If you also use the Garmin watch app
Kerfstok, these labels are sent to the watch app.</p>
<h2 class="western">Reminders</h2>
<p style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">

<h1>Sensor</h1>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The spinner contains
the name of the sensor. If Juggluco is using more than one sensor at
the same time, you can select for which sensor to show information.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><i><b>Doze mode</b></i>
leads you to a screen with information on how to disable battery
optimizations for Juggluco, that can prevent Juggluco from
functioning.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><i><b>Permission</b></i>:
Previous versions of Juggluco required location permission to find
the device address of the sensor. This is no longer necessary for the
sensors I use. Maybe there are still sensors out there for which it
is necessary; in that case you can turn it on. After the first
contact Juggluco saves the device address and location permission is
always useless. The device address, if known, is displayed after the
sensor identifier. Red means a US-like sensor.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Android 12 has a new
Nearby devices permission, which can be used instead of location
permission for searching for a Bluetooth device address, but it is
also needed for later contact with Bluetooth devices.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><i><b>Wakelock</b></i>:
Some users of Android 13 complain that Bluetooth stops functioning.
Possibly turning this option on helps them. On my smartphone I don\'t
need it and on Watch4 it doesn\'t make a difference. If it works, it
will increase battery usage.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><i><b>Terminate</b></i>:
stop connecting to this sensor via Bluetooth. If later you want again
receive stream glucose values from this sensor, you only have to scan
it again.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><i><b>Turbo</b></i>:
Increases effort to contact with sensor in the hope that it results
in less connection errors, but can uses more battery power. Seems to
be needed on Watch4 with Freestyle Libre 2 sensors, but not with
Freestyle Libre 3 sensors and on none of the smartphones I tried it
on.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Android 13</b>:
Two users with a buggy Android 13 phone claimed that this setting
solved their Bluetooth connection issues. Two users with Android 13
who previous didn\'t have connection problems claimed that they got
connection problems from this setting.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><i><b>Info</b></i>:
Gives start and end times and last scan and stream times of sensor.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To connect to a
Freestyle Libre 2 sensor via Low Energy Bluetooth, Bluetooth should
be turned on. Before the sensor is scanned successfully by this app,
nothing will happen. The sensor shouldn\'t be connected with FreeStyle
Libre reader or other applets on smartphones. Abbotts Librelink app\'s
alarms should be turned off or the app stopped. Some Librelink apps
seem to contact the sensor while alarms are turned off and can cause
connection problems, so use \'<i>force stop</i>\' to be certain. <b>Sensor
via Bluetooth/Use Bluetooth</b> should be turned on.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If the above
conditions are satisfied, it can still take a long time before the
app receives glucose values from the sensor. Often it takes a minute,
but at other times it takes much longer. The <i>Connection stage</i>
gives the most difficulties. The most frequent are failures with
status=133, which is the status argument of
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothGattCallback#onConnectionStateChange(android.bluetooth.BluetoothGatt,%20int,%20int)">onConnectionStateChange(BluetoothGatt
bluetoothGatt, int status, int newState)</a>. If you remove the
battery out of a sensor you also get this error, so it seems to be
something like <i>Bluetooth device not found</i>. Sometimes turning
Bluetooth off and on seems to help or rebooting the phone or turning
off the Bluetooth connection of other devices. Other problems are
sometimes resolved by scanning the sensor.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Scanning the sensor
with Juggluco (with <i>Sensor via Bluetooth</i> enabled) on another
phone, will steal the connection away from this phone and it can take
some time, with scanning in between, to get it back again.</p>

<span lang="en-US">smartwatches can be configured to receive these

other watches don\'t send this notification to the watch, probably
because it is a modification of a notification that is constantly

displays the current glucose value. Immediately as a new glucose

<h2 class="western">xDrip watch apps</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Juggluco
incorporates an xDrip webserver. This makes it possible to directly
use xDrip watch apps with Juggluco. xDrip displays a new glucose
value only every 5 minutes, while Juggluco displays a new glucose
value every minute. Juggluco also sends to the xDrip watch apps the
most recent glucose value. The glucose values are only send to the
watches if the watch app asks for them, thus how old the displayed
values are depends on when the watch app asks for them. For example
watch faces and data fields on Garmin watches only ask for a glucose
value every 5 minutes. Via xDrip this often let to 10 minute old
glucose values. When directly connected with Juggluco, these watch
faces show up to 6 minute old glucose values. Under </span><span lang="en-US"><b>Garmin</b></span><span lang="en-US">,
if you can\'t use Kerfstok, you have the following options to
regularly receive a recent glucose value. An xDrip widget

can also be used during the recording of an activity. So if you have
a hand free, you can switch to this xDrip widget while recording an
activity with a standard Garmin sport app. There is also an xDrip
sport app that updates its glucose value regularly:

be the ideal solution, but restrictions imposed by Garmin make them
of little value. </span>

<string name="wearosinfo" >
<![CDATA[
<h1 class="western">Wear Os</h1>
<p>A special version of Juggluco can run directly on a Wear Os watch.
It needs an Android smartphone with NFC to scan the sensor and via a
TCP connection this data is sent to the Wear OS watch. Hereafter
there are two possibilities:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>The sensor stays connected with the smartphone and the
	smartphone sends every glucose value it receives via Bluetooth to
	the Wear OS watch via TCP;</p>
	<li><p>It is also possible to directly connect the sensor with the
	Wear OS watch. For this you need a Wear OS watch with good Bluetooth
	connectivity. 
	</p>
</ol>
<p>You can get Juggluco for Wear OS from Google Play on your watch.
Some pictures are shown at
<a href="http://jkaltes.byethost16.com/JugglucoWearOS/index.html">http://jkaltes.byethost16.com/JugglucoWearOS</a></p>
<p>To get it working do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Ensure that both Bluetooth and WIFI are working on watch and
	phone;</p>
	<li><p>See that the watch has enough free storage space and RAM
	left. It is possible that Juggluco has to be reinstalled if the
	device runs out of storage space at a critical moment;</p>
	<li><p>Make the phone version of Juggluco working with the sensor.
	You have to scan the sensor a few times with &quot;Sensor via
	Bluetooth&quot; set. Receiving glucose values on the phone via
	Bluetooth is not necessary;</p>
	<li><p>Install the Wear OS version of Juggluco on your Wear Os watch
	and start it;</p>
	<li><p>On the phone go to left-menu-&gt;Watch-&gt;Wear Os Config.
	Your watch should be displayed in the spinner. Press &quot;Init
	watch app&quot;;</p>
	<li><p>If everything went well, in both Juggluco\'s a TCP connection
	is configured and all data on the phone is sent to the watch. This
	can take a long time if you were using Juggluco for a long time. You
	can check if the TCP connection is configured by looking in the
	Mirror dialog (phone: left middle menu-&gt;Mirror, watch:
	left-menu-&gt;Mirror). A connection with the same id as shown in the
	spinner for your watch should be shown. On the watch is should also
	contain the IP of the phone. If the are not there or the watch side
	doesn\'t contain an IP, press again on &quot;Init watch app&quot;. If
	it still isn\'t there, check the Bluetooth connection and the phone
	app responsible for the connection to your watch. (When the watch
	already has received data, pressing &quot;Init watch app&quot; has
	the effect of re-sending all, so you could as well re-install the
	watch version of Juggluco. Later on, if the right IP is not shown,
	you should on the phone turn the external connection (WIFI or Mobile
	data) off and on.</p>
	<li><p>If everything went well, the same data, as displayed on the
	phone version of Juggluco, is displayed on the watch version of
	Juggluco. Every new glucose value received by the phone is sent via
	TCP to the watch. Some settings like unit, glucose alarm levels and
	reminders are also transmitted to the watch. Later changes should be
	made on the watch itself. 
	</p>
	<li><p>If you have a smartwatch with good Bluetooth connectivity and
	you like to receive glucose values on your watch without having to
	carry your phone, you can connect the watch version of Juggluco
	directly with the sensor. After all values are sent to the watch,
	you can check <b>&quot;Direct sensor-watch connection&quot;</b>. By
	this, <i>&quot;sensor via Bluetooth&quot;</i> is turned off in the
	phone and turned on in the watch. The stream values are now sent
	from watch to phone as you can check in the Mirror dialog. You can\'t
	change &quot;Direct sensor-watch connection&quot; when watch and
	phone are not in sync.</p>
	<li><p>If you want to sent amounts from the watch to the phone, you
	should reverse the send-direction yourself in the Mirror dialog by
	unchecking it on the phone and checking it on the watch. On the
	phone &quot;<i>Receive from</i>&quot; should also be set. If
	everything isn\'t set exactly right, it doesn\'t work. &quot;Don\'t
	change amounts&quot; should be changed. The labels of <i>amounts</i>
	are always sent with the amounts. If you change the direction of the
	transmission of amounts from watch to phone, you can\'t change the
	labels. It shouldn\'t be too easy;</p>
</ul>
<p>If the sensor has a direct Bluetooth connection with the watch and
it\'s values are sent to a smartphone, scanned values should also be
sent from the phone to the watch and the stream values should be
synced before scanning the sensor with Juggluco (the settings are
configured automatically this way.) Otherwise, old values could be
sent back to the watch or modified authentication information is not
sent to the watch, which will result in <i>Unlock key</i> errors.</p>
<p>Changes to the connection should also only be made when the data
is synchronized; the data on phone and watch should be complete

amount data).</p>
<p>The first time, when a lot of data has to be transferred from
smartphone to watch, you can attach the watch to the charger. My
watch turns on WIFI when it is attached to the charger.</p>
<h5 class="western">Watch-Phone connection</h5>
<p>At initialization, when all data are sent from phone to watch, you
need a Wi-Fi connection between watch and phone. Later data is sent
in small pieces via TCP. On my watch that is redirected through
Bluetooth, but only when the phone has an external connection, for
example Wi-Fi to your home network, a mobile data connection or a
portable hotspot. Otherwise the connection between phone and watch
stops after some time, because Wi-Fi is turned off by the system to
save battery power.</p>
<p>Juggluco itself detects the IPs of the other side, so you don\'t
need to set them. If you switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data, the IPs
are changed automatically. Sometimes you have to switch Wi-Fi or
mobile data off and on on your smartphone before it works (Juggluco
determines the IP at the moment Wi-Fi or mobile data is turned on,
but sometimes the IP is then not available yet.)</p>
<p>Automatic determination of the IP of the other side is specific
for the connection with a WearOS watch; for other Mirror connections
you still need to specify the IPs of the other side.</p>
<h5 class="western">Watch face</h5>
<p>Juggluco for Wear OS includes a watch face that shows your current
glucose level besides the time and up to four complications. To make
use of it you have to select this watch face for example in your
watch companion app under &quot;downloaded&quot;. Normally you will
see the last glucose value when the screen wakes up. When the display
is in ambient (always on) mode, the glucose value is only updated
when the minute indicator is increased or you press a button or raise
your arm. So the displayed value can be up to one minute delayed.</p>
<p>There is also a complication that uses the Glucodata broadcast of
the WearOS version to display the glucose value in every watch face
that accepts the complication:

<![CDATA[
<h1>Libreview</h1>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Juggluco can send
glucose data and amounts to Libreview.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If you use Abbotts
Libre app for Freestyle Libre 2 sensors, Libreview is based on the
history data out of the memory of the sensor. For this you need to
scan the sensor.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Juggluco uses the
stream data received via Bluetooth to create these 15 minute points
by averaging the stream values around each point. Now and then it
also sends an individual stream value in the same way as individual
scanned values are sent to Libreview by Abbott\'s Librelink app.
Juggluco doesn\'t need to be constantly connected to the internet for
all data to be sent to Libreview. Like the Librelnk app, it sends
data from the last 89 days to Libreview. What is necessary is that
Juggluco is constantly connected to a Freestyle Libre 2 sensor via
Bluetooth. For Freestyle Libre 3 sensors the 5 minutes history data
is used, so that all previous values are sent to Libreview. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">To
make use of this service, you need to create a Libreview account at
<a class="western" href="https://libreview.com/">https://libreview.com</a>
and specify its E-Mail address and password here.</span> <span lang="en-US">Don\'t
send data from the same period multiple times to the same Libreview
account (for example from the Librelink app and Juggluco). You can
delete existing devices in Libreview in Account Settings-&gt;My
devices or you can take a new Libreview account.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">To
turn it on, you also need to check &quot;</span><span lang="en-US"><i><b>Send
to libreview</b></i></span><span lang="en-US"><i>&quot;</i></span><span lang="en-US">.
</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Juggluco will send
new data to Libreview every time you switch away from Juggluco when
it wasn\'t done in the previous 20 minutes. You can also manually send
it to Libreview by pressing <i>&quot;</i><i><b>Send now</b></i><i>&quot;</i>.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Beside glucose
values, amounts can also be sent to Libreview. For this you need to
touch &quot;<i><b>Send amounts</b></i>&quot; and specify what each
label means.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Starting with
Juggluco 4.1.0 glucose values from FreeStyle Libre 3 sensors are also
send to LibreView.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Resend data</b>:
Start anew; resend data of the last 90 days to Libreview. You need to
press this when switching to a new Libreview account.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Result of the last
time trying to send to Libreview is displayed below the &quot;Get
Account ID&quot; button.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Because the values
sent to Libreview are first averaged over 15 minutes and then
analyzed, there can be small differences between the values shown in
Juggluco\'s statistics screen and Libreview. For example Libreview
says 100% of the time active, while Juggluco\'s statistics screen says
96.0%. Also some high and low values will be averaged away, so that
Libreview gives a somewhat higher <i>time in target </i>than the
statistics screen of Juggluco. Because the real history values are
less extreme than the average of the stream values around a history
value, this difference will be larger when Libreview is based on
scanned values.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Juggluco can be
connected with multiple sensors at the same time, while Librelink
only handles one sensor at a time. Juggluco also sends data from only
one sensor at a time to Libreview. It does this by first sending the
data from one sensor and only after no data is available from that
sensor, it sends the data from the following sensor. When Juggluco is
switched to a following sensor, Juggluco will not turn back to a
previous one, to imitate the one sensor policy of Librelink. This
means that when you run multiple sensors at a time and a later added
one ends earlier than an earlier added sensor, this earlier sensor
will send no data anymore to Libreview.</p>
<p><b>Get Account ID</b>: If you only want to receive the LibreView
account ID, but not send data to Libreview, you can fill in your
E-Mail address and Password and press on &quot;<i>Get Account ID</i>&quot;.
On the same line before this button, the Account ID will be shown
(this can take some time and the screen is not refreshed
automatically). Retrieving the Account ID from the LibreView server
makes it possible to use a FreeStyle Libre 3 sensor that was already
used with Abbotts Libre 3 app with this LibreView account. Starting
the sensor with Juggluco is reported not to work.</p>
<p><b>WARNING</b>: The Freestyle Libre 3 sensor should be activated
with this account.</p>

</p>
<p>For labels send as comments to Libreview the following restriction
applies: after you change a label, will deletions and changes of
amounts entered under a previous label not result in modifications in
Libreview. For example, if you previously had the label Bike and
entered 20 then changed Bike into Cycling and modify 20 in 25, will
this change not result in a change in Libreview, but will both Bike
20 and Cycling 25 be present in Libreview. The only thing you can do

<![CDATA[
<p>Select how the Amounts in Juggluco
entered under a particular label should be sent to Libreview. It is
possible to send more than one type of amount with the same Libreview
label. For example if you score Carbohydrate and pure Glucose food
under separate labels in Juggluco, you can specify for both that they
should be sent as <b>Carbohydrate</b> to Libreview.</p>
<p>For Carbohydrate, it is possible to <b>multiply</b> the amount
given in Juggluco with a certain number so that you can transform
other units into grams. If you count in Juggluco servings of 10 gram,
you can enter here 10, so that grams will be sent to Libreview.</p>
<p><b>Comments</b> means that the amount is sent to Libreview as if
you added comments in Librelink. If you specify comments here, the
Label plus the number entered for that label is sent. For example:
&quot;<i>Bike 50</i>&quot;, if you had a label &quot;<i>Bike</i>&quot;
and you entered &quot;<i>50</i>&quot; under that label. &quot;<i>Bike
50</i>&quot; will be shown under the graph of the &quot;<i>Daily log</i>&quot;

<p>Upload to a Nightscout server. 
</p>
<p>In most cases you can also use the webserver in Juggluco or
<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/cmdline">juggluco-server</a>,
only AAPS and NSclient refuse to work when not connected to
<a href="https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor">cgm-remote-monitor</a>.</p>
<p>AAPS doesn\'t work when not connected to a Nightscout server. If
the functionality of this Artificial Pancreas is really dependent on
a Nightscout server, they could better put the Nightscout server in
AAPS, rather than making it dangerously dependent on an internet
connection. If the core functionally of AAPS is not dependent on
Nightscout, they could better remove the obligation to make use of
this Nightscout server.</p>
<p>All stream values are uploaded to the Nightscout server at the
moment they arrive. When multiple sensor are used, all values of all
sensors are uploaded. Some Garmin watch apps/faces/widgets assume
that the values are space 5 minutes apart. When they receive glucose
values one minute apart, they will only show the last fifth of the
curve. For that reason, the webserver incorporated in Juggluco spaces
the values 5 minutes apart, except when &quot;interval=secs&quot; is
set to a lower value.</p>
<p><b>URL</b>: the url should be in the form of https://hostname:port
for example, https://myname.herokuapp.com:6789</p>
<p><b>Active</b>: Turn server on</p>
<p><b>Resend data</b>: Upload all data again to the Nightscout server</p>
<p><b>Send now</b>: Normally data is immediately send when it arrives
from the sensor or a mirror connection. Press on this button when for
some reason a previous attempt failed.</p>
